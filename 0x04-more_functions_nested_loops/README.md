Task 0: unction that checks for uppercase character.
Prototype: int _isupper(int c);
Returns 1 if c is uppercase
Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: isupper. Run man isupper to learn more.


Task 1: function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);
Returns 1 if c is a digit
Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: isdigit. Run man isdigit to learn more.


Task 2: function that multiplies two integers


Task 3: function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_numbers(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code



Task 4: unction that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_most_numbers(void);
Do not print 2 and 4
You can only use _putchar twice in your code


Task 5: function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void more_numbers(void);
You can only use _putchar three times in your code


Task 6: function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
Prototype: void print_line(int n);
You can only use _putchar function to print
Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed
The line should end with a \n
If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n


Task 7: function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
Prototype: void print_diagonal(int n);
You can only use _putchar function to print
Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed
The diagonal should end with a \n
If n is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n


Task 8: prints a square, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_square(int size);
You can only use _putchar function to print
Where size is the size of the square
If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
Use the character # to print the square
