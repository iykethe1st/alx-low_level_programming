Task 0: function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);


Task 1: unction that swaps the values of two integers.
Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);


Task 2: function that returns the length of a string.
Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);

Task 3: function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
Prototype: void _puts(char *str);


Task 4: function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_rev(char *s);


Task 5: function that reverses a string.
Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);


Task6: function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void puts2(char *str);



Task 7: function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);
The function should print the second half of the string
If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2


Task 8: function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);


Task 9: function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
Return value: the pointer to dest
