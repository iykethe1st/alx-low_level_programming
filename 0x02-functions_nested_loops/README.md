## The header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files

Task 0: Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.
The program should return 0


Task 1: Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code


Task 3: function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code


Task 4: function that checks for lowercase character.
Prototype: int _islower(int c);
Returns 1 if c is lowercase
Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: islower. Run man islower to learn more.



Task 5: function that prints the sign of a number.
Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero
